# EE4216-Lab3: Spring Boot Vue2 Movie Database

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse, edit, and delete movie data from a database. The backend is built with Spring Boot and Maven, using RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on the movies table. The frontend is built with Vue2, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the movie data.

## Getting Started
